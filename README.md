# Find Your Hat
## Description
This is one of the projects to complete in the Codecademy syllabus for Front-End Development.

## How to use:
I recommend running the code in VS code using the Code Runner extension. You should be prompted once it's running to enter the number of holes you would like to add (increasing difficulty).
